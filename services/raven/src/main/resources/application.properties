# Disable automatic Docker Compose lifecycle management unless explicitly enabled.
# This prevents Spring Boot from failing to start during local development when no
# docker-compose.yml is present alongside the service. Override by setting the
# SPRING_DOCKER_COMPOSE_ENABLED environment variable to true when needed.
